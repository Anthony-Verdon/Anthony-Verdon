# Hi everyone !

## About Me
My name is Anthony Verdon, I'm a student at @42School of AngoulÃªme. I like to code and solve problems, and have some others occupations like gardening, take care of animals and doing sport.

## Current Projects
1. scop : render an object in 3D using OpenGL (currently, I want to update the parsing to use REGEX, and use Vulkan instead of OpenGL)
2. gamejams : I maybe not working on a gamejam when you read this, but I participate to gamejams sometimes (check my portfolio)
